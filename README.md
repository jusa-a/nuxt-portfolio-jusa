# My Personal Website/Portfolio

[www.jusaannevirta.com](https://www.jusaannevirta.com/)

A website to introduce myself, showcase my projects and other things I do.
Server Side Rendering, SEO friendly. Take advantage of a static site generator,
the data save as markdown, and no database is needed. Simple and clean design
with easy navigation and fast loading speed.

I started this project to learn new web development technologies and redo my old
portfolio website. Having already experience in React I wanted to learn Vue.js
so I chose Nuxt3 for my framework. It was also a good chance to try out and
learn Tailwind CSS.

This project has taught me a lot about web design and development with some of
the most modern technologies. I have really enjoyed the process of learning and
building something from scratch!

There are still many things to fix/improve, which I will continue to fix in near
future.

# Design

Website was designed to be modern and simple yet aesthetic and personal. It has
some experimental/brutalist elements while keeping in mind a great user
experience and accessibility.

The responsiveness of the website is made without using any CSS media queries.
This was possible with flexbox and CSS clamp functions, which resulted in a
website with beautiful smooth scaling from 300px up.

# Built with

-   **Nuxt3:** Framework for creating universal Vue.js applications. Provides a
    powerful development environment and many features to make building web
    applications easier.

    variety of formats, including Markdown, JSON and YAML, and easily access it

    create custom designs with minimal CSS.
