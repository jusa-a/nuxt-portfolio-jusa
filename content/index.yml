hero:
    Iâ€™m a multidisciplinary designer and developer with skills in many different
    domains. I work with digital technologies and experiences but also enjoy
    creating things that are not digital. I do all kinds of stuff from
    multidisciplinary design projects and web development to building things
    with my hands. Feel free to look around and explore!

projects:
    Selection of projects I have been involved with, primarily during my
    academic pursuits. These include work in diverse teams, covering a variety
    of disciplines from product innovation and development to industrial design,
    service design, and UX design.

works:
    Here is a selection of my own creations showcasing my passion for
    craftsmanship and functional aesthetics. The process of designing and
    building not only allows me to put my skills to use but also serves as an
    outlet for creativity, complementing my studies, team projects and work in
    the digital domain.
