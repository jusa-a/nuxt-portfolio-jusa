hero:
    Iâ€™m a multidisciplinary designer and developer with skills in many different
    domains. I work with digital technologies and experiences but also enjoy
    creating things that are not digital. I do all kinds of stuff from
    multidisciplinary design projects and web development to building things
    with my hands.

projects:
    Here are some of the projects I have been involved with. These are mainly
    projects done at school working in diverse teams. Topics vary from product
    innovation/development to industrial, service and UX design.

works:
    These are things designed and made by me. Showcasing my personal interests
    and desires towards craftsmanship with a focus on functionality and
    aesthetics. It's a nice balance for the team projects and the digital
    domain.
