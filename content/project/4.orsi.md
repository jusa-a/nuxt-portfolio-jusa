## Orsi

:image-container{:images="product"}

ORSI is the outcome of our team's collaborative effort on this project. It is a
universal hanging rod designed to fit any kitchen. ORSI provides a place in the
kitchen for the most important and frequently used utensils, be it a dish rack,
dish brush, paring knife or something else. ORSI brings space to the kitchen
while helping to keep the kitchen tidy.

Thanks to its changeable fasteners, ORSI can be installed either on a dish rack
or a smooth wall with suction cups. No screws or glue are required for
installation, making it easy toc use and portable.
