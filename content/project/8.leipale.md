## Craft Beer From Surplus Bread

In partnership with Olarin Panimo brewery and K-Market Otaniemi grocery store,
we developed and crafted a beer made using surplus bread. The beer was in
production in 2019 and was made available at dozens of Kesko stores. The project
can be considered a great success by helping to address the problem of food
waste while creating shared value through collaboration.

### Recognition

The project attained a good amount of media attention and was featured in major
news outlets like Helsingin Sanomat and Pirkka Magazine. It was also awarded the
'Deed of the Year' at the Kesko merchant awards. Our "Leipäle" beer was also
served at the Independence Day Reception held at the Presidential palace in
2019, highlighting the impact and recognition this project achieved.

### Context

This project was born out of a university course called Creating Value with the
goal of creating shared value for companies, stakeholders, and society. In our
project, we focused on sustainability and circular economy as the main theme of
our team.

This project showcased how to bring value to companies and customers while
minimizing waste, giving a great example of circular economy in practice. It
also taught important skills in product development, cooperation with partners
and teams, design thinking and effectuation.
