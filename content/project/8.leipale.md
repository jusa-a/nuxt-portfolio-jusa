## Craft Beer From Surplus Bread

This group project started on a university course called Creating Value with a
goal of creating value to company/companies and customers with sustainability
and circulation economy as the main theme of our team.

In collaboration with brewery Olarin panimo and grocery store K-Market Otaniemi
we developed and crafted a beer made with surplus bread. The beer was in
production in 2019 and was made available at dozens of Kesko stores.

This project attained a good amount of media attention and was reported by
Helsingin Sanomat and Pirkka Magazine among other news and media. The project
won the 'Deed of the Year' award at the Kesko merchant awards. Our "Leipäle"
beer was also served at the Independence Day Reception held at the Presidential
palace in 2019.
