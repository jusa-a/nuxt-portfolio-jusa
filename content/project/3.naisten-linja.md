## Growth hacking project for Naisten Linja's Turv@verkko project

Our goal was to increase awareness of the problematic normalization of online
violence against women and help people to identify online harassment cases. This
growth hacking project resulted in a social media ads campaign and landing page
optimization.

### Naisten Linja & Turv@verkko

Naisten Linja offers services to people who identify themselves as girls or
women and have experienced violence or abuse, or threat of violence or abuse,
and to those close to them.

Turv@verkko project is a three-year development and advocacy project funded by
the Social and Health Organizations Support Center STEA, which aims to prevent
digital violence against girls and women and help those who have experienced
digital violence to recover from their experience.

### Social Media Ads Campaign

Quotes from real experiences

Information about online violence and the service

Chat with harassing behaviour example

### Landing Page Optimizing

Landing page was created for the campaign to get measurable data. It provided
information about online harassment and Turv@verkko. Pages had more detailed
information about online harassment with real-world experiences, FAQ section and
contact details for contacting Naisten Linja.
