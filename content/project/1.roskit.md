## IoT Product Concept for Gamification

A web-based service for motivating citizens to throw trash away where it belongs
in public spaces. By scanning the QR-code (or NFC tag), when throwing trash in
one of rosk-it bins, users can collect points, earn prizes and compete with
other people

### The Problem

Many large cities like Helsinki struggle with littering and keeping public
spaces clean. Rubbish strewn across parks and bins stuffed to capacity have
become a regular sight in the capital region.

### The Solution

We came up with a smart trash bin solution with initiatives to motivate citizens
to keep public spaces clean. When people pick up trash and throw it in the
rosk-it trash bins they get points on a web app. The key idea is to make
throwing trash fun by gamifying the experience and encourage people to throw
trash where it belongs.
