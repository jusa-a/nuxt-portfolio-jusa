bio:
    - I'm a master's student with technical and analytical yet human-centric
      skills. As a tech-savvy designer focusing on users, data, development and
      design, I’m passionate about understanding and developing the interaction
      between human beings and digital technologies on an individual and
      societal level. Alongside studying I spend my time making music/sounds,
      building instruments or enjoying outdoors. Relying on open mind and
      creativity I’m curious to solve problems and learn new while utilising my
      skills and creating value.
