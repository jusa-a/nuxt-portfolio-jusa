## Guitar designed and hadcrafted by me

After building one tele and a les paul jr I decided to design and build my own
guitar. I wanted to buy as little materials and ready-made parts as possible
with aim of doing everything possible by myself.

Body is old Finnish black alder from my grandfather painted with handmade casein
paint. Neck 22.5” scale from leftover piece of maple with some mild flaming.
Hardware is mostly handmade from scrap brass, steel and random fasteners. Pickup
is custom widerange humbucker by Rautia Guitars.
