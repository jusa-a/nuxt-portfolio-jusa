## Pivoting wall lamp

Pivoting wall lamp handcrafted by me. Made from salvaged steel with an
adjustable lamp shade, giving it a unique character. The design draws
inspiration from the iconic Potence Lamp by Jean Prouv√©, known for its
minimalistic and functional aesthetic.

The minimalistic design and the use of salvaged materials make this lamp not
only a functional lighting solution but also a statement piece that adds a touch
of industrial and contemporary chic to the space.
