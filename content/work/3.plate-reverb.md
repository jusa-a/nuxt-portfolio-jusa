## A functional plate reverb in the form of a sculpture

The sculpture's design was inspired by the interest in creating a functional
piece of art that could be used in playing and making music. Plate reverb is a
type of effect simulating reverb by reflecting sound on a large metal plate.
This kind of technique is used in music production to add depth and space to
sound.

The sculpture consists of a steel frame with a thin steel plate tensioned in it.
The plate is driven by a speaker, which vibrates it to create the reverb effect.
A piezo element as a microphone then picks up the reverberated sound to be used
in music.

The sculpture was treated with steel blackening acid to give it a unique and
visually interesting look. The end result is a sound sculpture that blends
functionality and aesthetics serving as both an art piece and a musical
instrument.
