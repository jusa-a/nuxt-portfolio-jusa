## Redesigned and modified vintage cassette recorder

Vintage Sony TCM-919 cassette recorder deconstructed and rehoused in a new
enclosure. The handcrafted enclosure gives the recorder a fresh, modern look,
and also improves usability. The addition of variable speed control opens a new
realm of possibilities for experimental playing and sound manipulation.

Blending industrial design with mechanical engineering and electronics, the end
result is a carefully designed and crafted piece of equipment that combines
vintage nostalgia and modern functionality.
